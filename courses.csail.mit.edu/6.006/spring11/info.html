<h2>6.006: Introduction to Algorithms</h2>

<div class="header">Meeting locations and times</div>
<p>
Lectures will be held on <strong>Tuesdays and Thursdays</strong> from
<strong>11:00 AM to 12:00 PM</strong> in <strong><a
href="http://whereis.mit.edu/map-jpg?selection=32&amp;Buildings=go">32-123</a></strong>.
You are responsible for material presented in lectures, including oral
comments made by the lecturer (or other information that may not be
present in the slides), as well as in recitations:
</p>

<li><span class="staffname">WF3b</span> &ndash; Michael Kuo &ndash; 36-153</li>
</ul>

<div class="header">Prerequisites and credit</div>

<p>A firm grasp of Python and a solid background in discrete
mathematics are necessary prerequisites to this course.  You are
expected to have mastered the material presented in 6.01
(<em>Introduction to EECS I</em>) and 6.042J/18.062J (<em>Mathematics
for Computer Science</em>).</p>

<p>If you have not taken and been successful in each of these
subjects, please speak with a TA or professor before enrolling.  We do
allow students who have equivalent, other experience with the material
described above to enroll, but with the firm understanding that
mastery of this material is assumed and that course staff will not
feel obligated to cover it or to help students who are struggling with
it.</p>

<p>6.006 is a 12-unit (4-0-8) subject and serves as a Foundational
Computer Science subject under the new curriculum.  It is a direct
prerequisite for 6.046 (<em>Design and Analysis of Algorithms</em>),
the theory header.

<div class="header">Recitations</div>

<p>One-hour recitations are held on Wednesdays and Fridays.  You are
responsible for the material presented in recitation, <strong>which
may include new material not presented in lectures</strong>.
Recitation attendance has been well-correlated with quiz performance
in past semesters.  Recitations also give you a more intimate
opportunity to ask questions of and to interact with the course staff.
Your recitation instructor is responsible for determining your final
grade.</p>

<p>We do <strong>not</strong> use the recitation assignments made by
the scheduling office.  We will communicate your assignment to you
before the first recitation meeting.</p>

<div class="header">Problem sets</div> <p>We will assign seven <a
href="psets.html">problem sets</a> during the course of the semester.
For dates, check the <a href="calendar.html">course calendar</a>.
Each problem set will consist of a programming assignment, to be
completed in Python, and a theory assignment, to be typeset in LaTeX
and compiled to PDF.  (We will, however, accept scanned, hand-drawn
diagrams turned in with your PDF.)</p>

<p>If you collaborate with others in any fashion, you must list their
names as collaborators.  For details, please see the section on our
collaboration policy; we take this very seriously.</p>

<p>Late assignments will be severely penalized.  (This penalty is
currently a 1% deducation every six minutes or part thereof until the
end of the tenth hour after the deadline, after which submissions will
receive no credit.)  To avoid penalties, contact us <strong>in
advance</strong> to make arrangements.  Otherwise, we will require a
note from the appropriate dean advising us of your situation.</p>

<!--
<p>The problem sets include exercises that should be solved but not
handed in. These questions are intended to help you master the course
material and will be useful in solving the assigmed problems. Material
covered in exercises will be tested on exams.</p>
-->

<div class="header">Quizzes</div> <p>We will give two evening quizzes
during the semester; these will each be two hours in duration.  Check
the <a href="calendar.html">course calendar</a> for dates.  Each will
begin at 7:30 PM; room assignments will be announced in advance.
There will also be a final exam during finals week.</p>

<div class="header">Grading policy</div> <p>Your final grade will be
determined by the grades you recieve on problem sets, on quizzes, and
on the final.  The problem sets will together be worth approximately
30% of your grade; the quizzes, 20% each; and the final, 30%.  The
particulars of this policy are subject to the discretion of the course
staff.</p>

<div class="header">How we grade coding assignments</div>

<p>The code that you hand in will be graded based on its correctness,
its quality, and the details of the algorithm that it
implements.</p>

<p><strong>Correctness</strong> &mdash; We will provide a set of
public unit tests with each problem to help you test your work.
However, we will often use additional unit tests in grading; we
reserve the right to test any behavior specified by or following from
the problem statement.  Submissions that run for excessive amounts of
time may be scored as incorrect.</p>

<p><strong>Quality</strong> &mdash; Code should follow Python
conventions.  It should be neat, contain an appropriate quantity of
helpful comments, use appropriate variable names, and so forth.  Other
implementation characteristics that affect readability,
maintainability, or organization may also be graded.</p>

<p><strong>Theory</strong> &mdash; Code should represent an
implementation of an appropriately designed algorithm.  While we do
not necessarily expect you to achieve any lower bounds that may exist
for a particular problem, submissions should not be overly inefficient
in either time or space.</p>

<div class="header">How we grade written assignments</div>

<p>Responses to theory assignments <strong>must be typeset using LaTeX
and then compiled to PDF</strong>.  If you need to learn how to do
this, check the <a href="resources.html">resources section</a> or
your favorite search engine.  Templates for student solutions are
provided along with each problem set.. (We will, however, accept
scanned, hand-drawn diagrams turned in with your PDF.)</p>

<p>The best responses will be <strong>concise, correct, and
complete</strong>.  Failing to answer part of the question, being
overly verbose, missing special or edge cases, and answering
mistakenly will each reduce your score.</p>

<p>When you are called upon to "give an algorithm," you must provide
(1) a textual description of the algorithm, and, if helpful,
pseudocode; (2) at least one worked example or diagram to illustrate
how your algorithm works; (3) a proof (or other indication) of the
correctness of the algorithm; and (4) an analysis of the time
complexity (and, if relevant, the space complexity) of the
algorithm.</p>

<p><strong>Remember that, above all else, your goal is to
communicate.</strong> After all, if a grader cannot understand your
solution, they cannot give you any credit for it.</p>

<div class="header">Collaboration policy</div>

<p>The goal of homework is to give you practice in mastering the
course material. Consequently, you are encouraged to collaborate on
problem sets. In fact, students who form study groups generally do
better on exams than do students who work alone. If you do work in a
study group, however, you owe it to yourself and your group to be
prepared for your study group meeting. Specifically, you should spend
at least 30-45 minutes trying to solve each problem beforehand. If
your group is unable to solve a problem, try asking questions via <a
href="http://piazzza.com/">Piazzza</a> so that other groups and the
course staff can be helpful.</p>

<p><strong>You must write up each problem solution by yourself without
assistance</strong>, even if you collaborate with others to solve the
problem. You are asked on problem sets to identify your
collaborators. If you did not work with anyone, you should write
"Collaborators: none."  If you obtain a solution through research
(e.g., on the web), acknowledge your source, but write up the solution
in your own words. <strong>It is a violation of this policy to submit
a problem solution that you cannot orally explain to a member of the
course staff.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Code you submit must also be written by yourself.</strong>
You may receive help from your classmates during deugging.  Don't
spend hours trying to debug a problem in your code before asking for
help. However, regardless of who is helping you, only you are allowed
to make changes to your code.  <strong>Both manual and automatic
mechanisms will be employed to detect plagiarism in code.</strong>

<p>No other 6.006 student may use your solutions; this includes your
writing, code, tests, docu- mentation, etc. <strong>It is a violation
of the 6.006 collaboration policy to permit anyone other than 6.006
staff and yourself to see your solutions to either theory or code
questions.</strong></p>

<p>Plagiarism and other anti-intellectual behavior cannot be tolerated
in any academic environment that prides itself on individual
accomplishment. If you have any questions about the collaboration
policy, or if you feel that you may have violated the policy, please
talk to one of the course staff. Although the course staff is
obligated to deal with cheating appropriately, we often have the
ability to be more understanding and lenient if we find out from the
transgressor himself or herself rather than from a third party.</p>

<div class="header">Textbooks</div>

<p>The required textbook for the course is <em>Introduction to
Algorithms</em> (3rd Ed.) by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein (<a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-Third-Thomas-Cormen/dp/0262033844">Amazon</a>).
It is available wherever fine academic texts are sold.</p> <p>For the
student who finds books helpful, we also suggest <em>Problem Solving
With Algorithms and Data Structures Using Python</em> by Miller and
Ranum (<a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Problem-Solving-Algorithms-Structures-Python/dp/1590280539">Amazon</a>).</p>
